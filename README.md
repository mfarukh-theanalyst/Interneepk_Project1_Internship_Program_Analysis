# Internship Program Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes internship program data to identify the key factors that influence completion rates and to generate data-driven recommendations for improving overall program effectiveness. The analysis focuses on departmental performance, mentor interaction impact, preferred internship duration, and performance metrics to help optimize intern success and reduce dropout rates.

## Dataset Description
The synthetic dataset contains 5,000 internship records with the following attributes:

Core Attributes
- intern_id: Unique identifier for each intern
- department: Engineering, Data Science, Marketing, Design, HR, Web Dev.
- location: Illinois, Alaska, California, Michigan, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, Texas, Washington, Hawaii
- duration: Internship Program duration (3, 6, 9 months)
- mentor_meetings: Number of Mentor meetings (1-10)
- status: Internship completion status

Outcome Metrics
- completion_status: Completed or Dropped Out
- completion_date: Date of completion
- dropout_week: Week of dropout

## Business Problem
The objective is to understand what drives internship completion rates to:
- Improve overall program effectiveness
- Reduce dropout rates
- Strengthen mentorship structures
- Optimize resource allocation
- Enhance intern learning experiences and outcomes

## Technologies Used
- Microsoft Excel
- Power BI Desktop

## Key Features of the Analysis

Data Analysis
- Completion rate analysis by department, mentorship level, and duration
- Departmental comparison metrics between completed and dropped interns
- Correlation analysis to identify strong predictors of success

Visualizations
- Department-wise completion rates
- Mentor interaction impact
- Impact of Geographical location on completion rate
- Internship duration and completion trends

## Key Findings

- **Completion Status**:
Approximately 58% of interns completed the internship. Among them, the Data Science department had the highest number of successful completions, while the Design department had the lowest.

- **Departmental Factor**:
The completion rate in the Data Science department increases as mentor interaction increases. In contrast, the Design department shows no significant improvement in completion rate despite higher mentor interaction.

- **Internship Duration**:
Interns across most departments prefer a 3-month internship duration.

- **Mentor Impact**:
The interns of the Data Science department achieved a high completion rate of 80.6% with a low number of mentor meetings; meanwhile, the interns of the Design department achieved the lowest completion rate of 36.5% with a high number of mentor meetings.

- **Geographic Location**:
The geographic location of interns has minimal impact on their performance.

- **Focus Area**:
The Design department emerged as a key improvement area, with the lowest completion rate at 36.5%. In contrast, the Data Science department set the benchmark with a completion rate of 80.6%.


## Data-Driven Recommendations
- **Improve Design Department Support**: Provide targeted training and structured guidance to address the department’s low completion rate (36.5%).
- **Strengthen Mentor Engagement**: Standardize regular mentor–intern interactions, as high mentor support boosts completion rates to 77.7%.
- **Adopt a 3-Month Internship Model**: Offer 3-month internships as the default option since most interns prefer this duration.
- **Use Data Science as a Benchmark**: Replicate the successful practices of the Data Science department, which leads with an 80.6% completion rate.
- **Maintain Equal Access Regardless of Location**: Continue remote-friendly processes, as geographic location has minimal impact on intern performance.
- **Increase Overall Completion Support**: Introduce milestone tracking and early interventions to raise the overall completion rate beyond 58%.


## Business Impact
- This project delivered meaningful insights into intern performance across departments, mentorship effectiveness, and program structure.
- By strengthening mentor engagement, standardizing the preferred 3-month internship duration, and addressing the Design department’s low completion rate through targeted support, the organization can significantly enhance intern outcomes.
- Implementing these data-driven strategies could potentially raise overall completion rates by 8–12% and reduce departmental performance gaps by up to 25%.
